# osu-api-tools
Comprehensive and modular program for fetching, formatting, and storing data from the osu api, mostly for the osu!alternative project

Any executables not tagged as csv require a database service to be active. Programs were built with PostgreSQL.

This repo also contains the code for the osu!alternative bot that interfaces with the data
